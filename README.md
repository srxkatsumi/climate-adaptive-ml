# Climate Adaptive ML

Daily ensemble forecasting system for temperature, precipitation, extreme events, and wind across three distinct climate regimes.

---

## Research objective

Test whether an **adaptive ensemble with temporal decay** outperforms static ML baselines and climatology persistence across multiple climate zones. Results feed a scientific paper targeting *Atmospheric Research* or *Weather and Forecasting*.

**Null hypothesis:** adaptive ensemble = static ensemble  
**Alternative:** adaptive ensemble > static ensemble (statistically significant)

## Climate zones studied

| City | Country | Köppen | Regime |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Barcelona | Spain | Csa | Mediterranean |
| São Paulo | Brazil | Cfa | Tropical humid |
| Manaus | Brazil | Af | Equatorial |

---

## Three models compared

| # | Model | Role |
|---|-------|------|
| 1 | Climatology persistence | Minimum benchmark — any model must beat this |
| 2 | Static Random Forest | Simple ML state of the art — fixed weights |
| 3 | **Adaptive Ensemble** (RF + GB + SGD) | The contribution — temporal decay + weight adaptation |

## Variables forecast

| Variable | Horizons | Metrics |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Temperature (max / min / mean) | D+1 to D+15 | MAE, RMSE, ACC |
| Precipitation | D+1 to D+15 | MAE, RMSE, BSS, HSS |
| Extreme events (heat wave, drought, heavy rain) | Binary | HSS, BSS, POD, FAR |
| Wind speed | D+1 to D+7 | MAE, RMSE |

Statistical significance tested with the **Diebold-Mariano test**.

## Scientific novelty

1. **Temporal decay in live production** — not backtesting on known data
2. **Spearman ρ as confidence indicator** — adapted from financial ML, novel in climate forecasting
3. **Three simultaneous climate regimes** — demonstrates generalization, not geographic overfitting
